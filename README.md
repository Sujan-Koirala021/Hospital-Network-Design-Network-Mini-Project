# Hospital Network Design

## Overview
This project implements a simple network topology for an imaginary hospital, created as part of a Network Mini Project using Cisco Packet Tracer. The design aims to showcase efficient network management and connectivity within a healthcare environment.


## Project Description
The Hospital Network Design project demonstrates the deployment of a network that supports various hospital departments, ensuring secure and reliable communication. The topology includes connections for administrative offices, patient management, and medical equipment.

## Technologies Used
- Cisco Packet Tracer
- Networking Protocols (TCP/IP, DHCP, etc.)

## Installation
1. Download and install [Cisco Packet Tracer](https://www.netacad.com/courses/packet-tracer).
2. Clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Sujan-Koirala021/Hospital-Network-Design-Network-Mini-Project
```
3. Open the Project File:
Navigate to the cloned directory and open the .pkt file in Cisco Packet Tracer.

## Usage
1. **Open the Project File**:  
   Launch Cisco Packet Tracer and load the `.pkt` file you opened in the previous step.

2. **Explore the Network Topology**:  
   Click on various devices within the topology to view their configurations and settings.

3. **Simulate Network Traffic**:  
   Use the simulation mode in Cisco Packet Tracer to generate network traffic and observe how data flows through the network.

4. **Test Connectivity**:  
   Use the command line interface (CLI) on the devices to ping other devices and verify connectivity.

5. **Modify Configurations**:  
   Feel free to make changes to the network configuration and observe how it affects network performance and connectivity.
